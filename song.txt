All the ladies of the canyon 
Wearing black to the house parties 
Crosby, Stills and Nash is playing 
Wine is flowing with Bacardi 
But sometimes girls just want to have fun 
The poetry inside of me is warm like a gun

All the ladies of the canyon 
Wearing white for their tea parties 
Playing games of repetition 
Meditating in the garden 
And I love the little games that we play 
From the valley to the beach 
And when at last the day is done, I grab my keys
